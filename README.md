# Raycasting-A.I.
I've built a neural network controlling cars moving on a highway. The cars use rays to avoid the walls of the highway. Implementing neuroevolution (genetic algorithm). The code is online (work in progress): https://repl.it/@simontiger/Raytracing-AI  The raytracing part of the code largely comes from Daniel Shiffman.

I'm also eventually going to make a version of this using TensorFlow.js because with the toy library i'm using now it's surprisingly linear. I'm going to put more hidden layers in the network.
