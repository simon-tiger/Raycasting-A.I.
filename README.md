# Raycasting-A.I.
Trying to build a neural network controlling cars moving on a highway. The cars use rays to avoid the walls of the highway. Implementing neuroevolution. The code is online (work in progress): https://repl.it/@simontiger/Raytracing-AI  The raytracing part of the code largely comes from Daniel Shiffman.
